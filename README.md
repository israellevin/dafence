A simple game of conquest.

Hardly anything here ATM, but you can run server.py, which will run a local server on port 8000, and then open a browser at http://0.0.0.0:8000 to see the board. Clicking on a cell will own it (currently as root, the only user) and dive into it. Which means you will not notice it is owned till you pop back up. Silly, I know.
